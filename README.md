Hacking nature with @geohotz #COVID19 #sars-cov-2

## Open Questions

* How is orf1ab cleaved into polypeptides?  Can we predict this from the sequence?
* Which protein is the immune system responding to?

## Work to be done

* Automatic extraction of genes from different coronaviruses
* Good multisequence compare tool
* Molecular dynamics?
